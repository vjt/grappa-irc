# grappa-irc — design notes

Companion to [`README.md`](../README.md). The README is the current spec; this file is the chronological **record of decisions** — the conversations that got us here, captured so contributors can see *why* the spec looks the way it does.

Public-safe extract. Many of these decisions happened in open IRC channels and are also summarised on [sindro.me](https://sindro.me/posts/2026-04-20-grappa-irc-reinventing-irc-for-2026/).

## One-line mental model

**"grappa is the equivalent of irssi inside tmux."**

— vjt, #it-opers, 2026-04-20. The whole architecture collapses into this sentence when talking to anyone who's been on IRC for more than ten years: a persistent always-on session wrapper, not a second ircd, not a chat-app.

---

## Thesis — IRC as a slow tool

> *"secondo me c'è davvero spazio e desiderio di uno strumento 'lento' come irc"*
> — vjt, 2026-04-23

grappa isn't competing with Slack or Discord. The target audience is people who **want** a tool that's 30 years old, text-only, and indifferent to engagement metrics. No reactions on reactions, no "is-typing", no presence surveillance, no unfurls. Just text, on any device, always on. Counter-reaction to fast-feed churn.

A separate `MANIFESTO.md` will carry this pitch to the public — target audience: *nerd nostalgici* + anyone tired of dopamine-pump chat. Short, punchy, shareable. That document is deliberately not pre-drafted: the key sentence has to come from vjt.

## Origins — the Azzurra thread

This is the third instrument built for the same crew over 24 years:

1. **2002 — bahamut-inet6** — forking Bahamut to add IPv6 + SSL because the Italian IRC network needed it. [Post.](https://sindro.me/posts/2026-04-13-bahamut-fork-azzurra-irc-ipv6-ssl/)
2. **2002–2005 — suxserv** — writing IRC services from scratch in C, multithreaded, SQL-backed, because the off-the-shelf ones weren't good enough. [Post.](https://sindro.me/posts/2026-04-14-suxserv-multithreaded-sql-irc-services/)
3. **2026 — grappa + cicchetto** — making the same network liveable on a phone without making it not-IRC. [Kickoff post.](https://sindro.me/posts/2026-04-17-claude-walks-into-it-opers/)

The throughline is "if the existing thing is almost right but not quite, write the thing." Nostalgia is admitted; it is also a feature — the network itself is what persists, and carrying it forward is worth the effort.

## Naming

**grappa** (server) + **cicchetto** (client) — the Italian remix of **soju** (Korean distillate) + **gamja** (potato, the accompaniment): an Italian distillate plus the small glass of wine served at a Venetian *bàcaro*. Short, binary, parlante to anyone who's sat in an osteria.

It also doubles as a nod to the [Italian Hackers' Embassy](https://italiangrappa.it/), whose call-sign *Italian Grappa!* has been the shorthand for the Italian village at European hacker camps since 2001. grappa-irc is not affiliated; the reference is in the spirit it was intended — Italian hackers showing up somewhere with a bottle.

*Named 2026-04-20.*

## Chronological decision log

Each entry ends with *how to apply* — the durable rule that survives the conversation.

### 2026-04-18 — the pitch

vjt sketched it out in #it-opers: a fleet of processes, one per user, always connected to IRC, exposing an API; plus a web client / PWA that looks as close to irssi as possible. Power users keep their irssi (via a classic bouncer connection); casual users get the PWA and keep their scrollback across disconnects.

**Apply:** the shape is "persistent per-user session + API + irssi-shape PWA." Anything else is a distraction.

---

### 2026-04-19 — rejected: terminal-in-browser + WS-IRC transports

vjt tried several existing bouncers hands-on and didn't like any. Two shapes explicitly ruled out:

- **Terminal in the browser** (weechat-relay + Glowing Bear). Fidelity without abstraction — you're shipping a TTY, not a product.
- **IRC-over-WebSocket** to the web client (soju + gamja's native transport). The client ends up re-implementing IRC protocol state in JS. Principled, but not what we want.

**Apply:** the web client does not parse IRC. Ever. REST is the contract; IRC terminates at the server. See README §"Design principles", point 1.

---

### 2026-04-20 — server architecture pitch

Dictated in #sniffo:

- **Server:** Rust, persistent, one **tokio task per user** (green-thread per user, not OS-thread). Connects upstream, stays connected. **Authenticated HTTP API** — no server-side UI. **Auth via NickServ** (SASL for login, proxied `REGISTER` for signup). **State persisted** on disk or lightweight KV. **Scrollback is lazy** — pagination on scroll, not firehose. **Network-agnostic** with sysadmin allowlist. **Self-hostable** anywhere.
- **Client:** TypeScript-flavoured PWA. Fetches current state on connect (channel list + last N lines). Visually irssi on desktop; mobile = same irssi shape + touch-ergonomic helpers. No chat-app metaphor.

**Apply:** Tech stack for Phase 1: `tokio` + `axum` + `sqlx` + sqlite + the `irc` crate. Client framework still open (candidates: Svelte, SolidJS, lit-html). Themability is a first-class feature (irssi `.theme` parser portable to TS — grammar is simple).

---

### 2026-04-20 — rejected: forking soju

Before committing to greenfield, the question: can we land this as a fork of [soju](https://soju.im/)?

Verdict: **dead on arrival**. soju's design identity is IRCv3-first — every feature beyond vanilla IRC ships as an IRCv3 extension. The WS support they added is "IRC framing over WebSocket," not REST. A REST surface bolted on would bifurcate state (IRC message stream vs REST resource tree) and fight the project's DNA; upstream would close the PR with "propose an IRCv3 extension instead."

**Apply:** **read soju for behavior, don't fork it.** The reusable lessons: SASL bridging, scrollback ring-buffer semantics, reconnect/retry policy. The architecture is ours.

---

### 2026-04-20 — IRCv3 is opportunistic, not required

Upstream `CHATHISTORY` is essentially [soju](https://soju.im/) + [Ergo](https://ergo.chat/); not in bahamut-family or ratbox. That's the vast majority of deployed networks.

Consequence: **grappa must fully function against a classic IRC server speaking only `CAP LS` + SASL.** Anything beyond — `server-time`, `message-tags`, `labeled-response`, `CHATHISTORY` — is a bonus used when the upstream supports it.

Scrollback is **bouncer-owned**. One sqlite-backed ring-buffer per user, paginated API for REST, `CHATHISTORY` mapping if/when we add the IRCv3 listener (see below). No dependency on the upstream ircd providing history.

**Apply:** never assume IRCv3 on the upstream. The only universal requirements are `CAP LS` + SASL. Everything else is negotiated.

---

### 2026-04-20 — decision: two facades, one store

Question (raised in #it-opers): can classic IRCv3-capable clients talk to grappa directly, or is the PWA the only consumer?

Landing:

- **One scrollback store.** sqlite or any KV. Shared.
- **Facade A — REST + SSE** — primary. Consumed by cicchetto. Canonical surface. This is the design center.
- **Facade B — IRCv3 listener** (`CAP LS` + SASL + `CHATHISTORY`) — secondary, **phase 2+**. A *view* over the same store for existing IRCv3 mobile clients (Goguma, Quassel mobile). Not a source of truth.
- **No bifurcation rule.** The IRC listener MUST NOT introduce state the REST surface does not also expose. In particular, **no server-side `MARKREAD` / read watermark on either facade** — per the decision below.

**Apply:** when scoping the MVP, the IRCv3 listener is explicitly **out of scope for v1**. The scrollback schema must be designed so that a `CHATHISTORY` mapping is a mechanical translation, not a redesign. Required schema properties: monotonic msgid, `server-time` on every row, per-channel and per-target indexing, no `MARKREAD` column.

---

### 2026-04-20 — decision: no server-side read cursors

vjt: *"se metti il server a tenere non solo lo stato dei client connessi ma anche fin dove hanno letto.. meh"*.

Read position is a UX concern, not a protocol concern. Servers that track per-client read watermarks end up owning a state that belongs to the user's current view. Multiple open tabs, multiple devices, stale reconnects — the edge cases multiply fast and the value delivered is thin.

**Apply:** scrollback pagination stays; `MARKREAD` does not. Same rule on both facades. Clients track their own read position however they like (localStorage, IndexedDB, whatever). If that turns out to be wrong, we can add it later without breaking anything — but the inverse (shipping it then taking it away) is impossible.

---

### 2026-04-20 — decision: the client is the source of truth for UI state

vjt: *"io il server lo terrei puro e semplice / lo stato è lato client / i canali in cui sei è lato client / il server è solo un dispatcher"*.

Sonic: *"lo stato è cmq su grappa"* — fair, and correct: grappa *must* persist session state (which networks a user is attached to, which channels they've joined upstream). The design intent is narrower than Sonic's reading: the **client** is source of truth for **UI state** (which channel view is open, scroll position, read cursor, theme), not for session state. Server persists what must survive reconnect; client decides what to show.

**Apply:** API exposes *session state* (networks, channels, scrollback). API does not expose *UI state* (read cursor, "active channel", unread counts). If the client wants unread counts, it computes them locally from scrollback + its own read cursor.

---

### 2026-04-20 — decision: grappa is not an ircd

> *"grappa NON è un server irc / è un modo per rimanere connessi a irc e accedervi via webapp"*

If you want a classic IRC client, you bypass grappa and go straight to the upstream ircd. grappa is not replacing anyone's connection to Azzurra or Libera. It is a persistent-session + REST layer on top of existing IRC. That framing matters for scope control: we are not shipping features an ircd would ship.

**Apply:** never pitch grappa as an IRC server. It's a bouncer-and-then-some. The framing "always-on session wrapper, consumable from a phone" is correct; "modern IRC server" is wrong.

---

### 2026-04-20 — canonical elevator pitch (vjt's words)

Flagged as *"memorizza queste ultime righe perché sono una bella sintesi efficace di grappa"*. Treat as authoritative phrasing, reusable verbatim:

- *"grappa bnc irc <-> web"* — one-line architecture: bouncer between IRC upstream and web.
- *"cicchetto consuma grappa e mostra UI themabl[e]"* — cicchetto is the client, consumes grappa's API, ships themable UI.
- *"as irssi, mirc, erc, xchat quel che si vuole"* — themability target: parity with classic IRC clients, user picks.
- *"grappa espone anche ircv3 se vuoi usare quassel o simili"* — the phase-2 IRCv3 listener is the downstream facade for mobile IRCv3 clients.
- *"se vuoi usare irssi su grappa praticamente è solo un bnc"* — classic IRC client through grappa = pure bouncer experience.
- *"se invece usi cicchetto o quassel, hai anche la history"* — scrollback is what you gain with cicchetto OR any IRCv3 client. irssi-via-grappa = bouncer-only.
- *"plain and simple / irc solo irc"* — minimalism as a feature. No images, no voice, no *cagate*.

**Apply:** when describing grappa to a newcomer (README, blog, manifesto, issue comment) lead with `grappa bnc irc <-> web` + `cicchetto consuma grappa`, then fan out: themable UI, IRCv3 facade for mobile, history via cicchetto or IRCv3, *plain and simple* as closer.

---

## Design-hygiene rules in force

Roll-up of the decisions above as a pre-merge checklist:

- **Wire stays text.** No images, voice, video, file transfer, link unfurl beyond text URLs.
- **Web client never parses IRC.** REST is the contract.
- **IRC terminates at the server.** One parser, on the server, period.
- **No upstream IRCv3 dependency.** `CAP LS` + SASL is the floor.
- **Scrollback is bouncer-owned** and paginated. sqlite is the reference store.
- **No server-side read cursor.** Read position stays on the client.
- **No push infrastructure.** PWA browser push only, if available.
- **No multi-tenant SaaS mode.** Self-hosted only.
- **Mobile is an ergonomics layer on irssi-shape**, not a different shape.
- **Accessibility (TTS/STT, contrast, typography) lives in cicchetto**, not on the server.

---

## Open design questions

Tracked here until resolved in the README or an issue.

- **Client framework:** Svelte vs SolidJS vs plain lit-html. Decision deferred to Phase 3 (client walking skeleton). Criteria: PWA shell ergonomics, service-worker story, bundle size budget (≤200 KB gzip target before optional Vosk/piper drop-ins).
- **KV vs sqlite for scrollback:** sqlite is the current default. The pagination-heavy access pattern + per-user row counts + the need for indexed lookup by (channel, server-time) all favour SQL. Revisit only if the sqlite file turns out to be the bottleneck.
- **Session token format:** short-lived access + long-lived refresh, or single long-lived + revocation list. Phase 2 concern.
- **How to expose multi-network per user in the UI** without descending into tree-view hell. Phase 3 concern.

## What's *not* in this document (on purpose)

- Anything that was decided inside a private channel and hasn't been published elsewhere. The repo is public; private crew chatter stays private.
- Implementation scheduling ("I'll do X next week") — that belongs on the issue tracker, not in-repo.
- Anything that belongs in `CONTRIBUTING.md` or a future issue template — to be added when the project moves past spec-only.
