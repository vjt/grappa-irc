# grappa-irc — design notes

Companion to [`README.md`](../README.md). The README is the current spec; this file is the chronological **record of decisions** — the conversations that got us here, captured so contributors can see *why* the spec looks the way it does.

Public-safe extract. Many of these decisions happened in open IRC channels and are also summarised on [sindro.me](https://sindro.me/posts/2026-04-20-grappa-irc-reinventing-irc-for-2026/).

## One-line mental model

**"grappa is the equivalent of irssi inside tmux."**

— vjt, #it-opers, 2026-04-20. The whole architecture collapses into this sentence when talking to anyone who's been on IRC for more than ten years: a persistent always-on session wrapper, not a second ircd, not a chat-app.

---

## Thesis — IRC as a slow tool

> *"secondo me c'è davvero spazio e desiderio di uno strumento 'lento' come irc"*
> — vjt, 2026-04-23

grappa isn't competing with Slack or Discord. The target audience is people who **want** a tool that's 30 years old, text-only, and indifferent to engagement metrics. No reactions on reactions, no "is-typing", no presence surveillance, no unfurls. Just text, on any device, always on. Counter-reaction to fast-feed churn.

A separate `MANIFESTO.md` will carry this pitch to the public — target audience: *nerd nostalgici* + anyone tired of dopamine-pump chat. Short, punchy, shareable. That document is deliberately not pre-drafted: the key sentence has to come from vjt.

## Origins — the Azzurra thread

This is the third instrument built for the same crew over 24 years:

1. **2002 — bahamut-inet6** — forking Bahamut to add IPv6 + SSL because the Italian IRC network needed it. [Post.](https://sindro.me/posts/2026-04-13-bahamut-fork-azzurra-irc-ipv6-ssl/)
2. **2002–2005 — suxserv** — writing IRC services from scratch in C, multithreaded, SQL-backed, because the off-the-shelf ones weren't good enough. [Post.](https://sindro.me/posts/2026-04-14-suxserv-multithreaded-sql-irc-services/)
3. **2026 — grappa + cicchetto** — making the same network liveable on a phone without making it not-IRC. [Kickoff post.](https://sindro.me/posts/2026-04-17-claude-walks-into-it-opers/)

The throughline is "if the existing thing is almost right but not quite, write the thing." Nostalgia is admitted; it is also a feature — the network itself is what persists, and carrying it forward is worth the effort.

---

## Naming

**grappa** (server) + **cicchetto** (client) — the Italian remix of **soju** (Korean distillate) + **gamja** (potato, the accompaniment): an Italian distillate plus the small glass of wine served at a Venetian *bàcaro*. Short, binary, parlante to anyone who's sat in an osteria.

It also doubles as a nod to the [Italian Hackers' Embassy](https://italiangrappa.it/), whose call-sign *Italian Grappa!* has been the shorthand for the Italian village at European hacker camps since 2001. grappa-irc is not affiliated; the reference is in the spirit it was intended — Italian hackers showing up somewhere with a bottle.

*Named 2026-04-20.*

## Chronological decision log

Each entry ends with *how to apply* — the durable rule that survives the conversation.

### Archived months

Everything before **2026-10** lives in [`design_notes/`](design_notes/), moved
**verbatim** by #1537, issue 2138 and issue 2335 — not one entry was edited, cut,
reordered or judged obsolete. A ruling from May is still one grep away, over
two paths instead of one:

```
grep -rn '<pattern>' docs/DESIGN_NOTES.md docs/design_notes/
```

| month | file | `##` sections |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-04 | [`design_notes/2026-04.md`](design_notes/2026-04.md) | 10 |

`2026-04.md` carries **every April entry there is**. In this repo an entry is a
`##` heading — that is the definition `scripts/design-notes-gate.sh` enforces,
and a `###` is a subsection *inside* an entry. The **2026-04-18 … 2026-04-26**
items below are `###`: narrative of this preamble, which is also how #1537
counted them when it fixed the undated preamble at lines 1–328.

> **Looking for an April ruling and not finding it in `2026-04.md`?** The
> preamble above carries April-dated `###` subsections (2026-04-18 …
> 2026-04-26) — search this file too.

**Open design questions** and **What's *not* in this document** stayed for a
different reason — they are document sections, not months. `git log -S` puts
both in `b7b08375` (2026-04-24), the same commit as this preamble; later
entries were simply appended underneath them.

New entries keep going to the tail of **this** file. The archives are frozen:
nothing appends to them, which is why they carry `merge=text` and not this
file's `merge=union` (see `.gitattributes`). Keeping the rollover up to date is
no longer down to somebody remembering it: `scripts/design-notes-gate.sh` fails
when a month older than the newest one here is still inline (issue 2138).

### 2026-04-18 — the pitch

vjt sketched it out in #it-opers: a fleet of processes, one per user, always connected to IRC, exposing an API; plus a web client / PWA that looks as close to irssi as possible. Power users keep their irssi (via a classic bouncer connection); casual users get the PWA and keep their scrollback across disconnects.

**Apply:** the shape is "persistent per-user session + API + irssi-shape PWA." Anything else is a distraction.

---

### 2026-04-19 — rejected: terminal-in-browser + WS-IRC transports

vjt tried several existing bouncers hands-on and didn't like any. Two shapes explicitly ruled out:

- **Terminal in the browser** (weechat-relay + Glowing Bear). Fidelity without abstraction — you're shipping a TTY, not a product.
- **IRC-over-WebSocket** to the web client (soju + gamja's native transport). The client ends up re-implementing IRC protocol state in JS.

**Apply:** the web client does not parse IRC. Ever. REST is the contract; IRC terminates at the server. See README §"Design principles", point 1.

---

### 2026-04-20 — server architecture pitch

Dictated in #sniffo:

- **Server:** Elixir/OTP, one **supervised GenServer per user session**, always connected upstream. Authenticated HTTP API, no server-side UI. Auth via NickServ (SASL login, proxied `REGISTER` signup). State persisted via Ecto+sqlite. Scrollback lazy — pagination on scroll, not firehose. Network-agnostic with sysadmin allowlist. Self-hostable anywhere.
- **Client:** TypeScript-flavoured PWA. Fetches current state on connect, then subscribes to Phoenix Channels for live event push. Visually irssi on desktop; mobile = same irssi shape + touch-ergonomic helpers. No chat-app metaphor.

**Apply:** Phase 1 stack: Elixir + Erlang/OTP + Phoenix + Ecto + `ecto_sqlite3` + own IRC client module (binary pattern matching). Streaming surface is **Phoenix Channels**. Client framework left open (Svelte, SolidJS, lit-html — all integrate with `phoenix.js`, 3KB, framework-agnostic). Themability is a first-class feature (irssi `.theme` grammar is simple, portable to TS).

---

### 2026-04-20 — rejected: forking soju

Verdict: **dead on arrival**. soju's design identity is IRCv3-first — every feature ships as an IRCv3 extension; its WS support is "IRC framing over WebSocket," not REST. A bolted-on REST surface would bifurcate state (IRC message stream vs REST resource tree) and fight the project's DNA; upstream would close the PR with "propose an IRCv3 extension instead."

**Apply:** **read soju for behavior, don't fork it.** Reusable lessons: SASL bridging, scrollback ring-buffer semantics, reconnect/retry policy. The architecture is ours.

---

### 2026-04-20 — IRCv3 is opportunistic, not required

Upstream `CHATHISTORY` is essentially soju + Ergo; not in bahamut-family or ratbox — i.e. absent from the vast majority of deployed networks. grappa must fully function against a classic server speaking only `CAP LS` + SASL; `server-time`, `message-tags`, `labeled-response`, `CHATHISTORY` are bonuses when advertised. Scrollback is **bouncer-owned** (sqlite per user, paginated API; `CHATHISTORY` mapping if/when the IRCv3 listener lands).

**Apply:** never assume IRCv3 on the upstream. The only universal requirements are `CAP LS` + SASL. Everything else is negotiated.

---

### 2026-04-20 — decision: two facades, one store

- **One scrollback store** (sqlite or any KV), shared.
- **Facade A — REST + SSE** — primary, consumed by cicchetto. The design center.
- **Facade B — IRCv3 listener** (`CAP LS` + SASL + `CHATHISTORY`) — secondary, phase 2+. A *view* over the same store for existing IRCv3 mobile clients (Goguma, Quassel mobile). Not a source of truth.
- **No bifurcation rule.** The IRC listener MUST NOT introduce state the REST surface does not also expose. In particular, no server-side `MARKREAD` / read watermark on either facade — per the decision below.

**Apply:** the IRCv3 listener is explicitly **out of scope for v1**, but the scrollback schema must make `CHATHISTORY` a mechanical translation, not a redesign: monotonic msgid, `server-time` on every row, per-channel and per-target indexing, no `MARKREAD` column.

---

### 2026-04-20 — decision: no server-side read cursors

Superseded by the 2026-05-13 "CP29 server-side read-state cluster" entry: read state is now server-owned per (subject, network, channel), and removing the server-side cursor is a breaking change.

---

### 2026-04-20 — decision: the client is the source of truth for UI state

vjt: *"io il server lo terrei puro e semplice / lo stato è lato client / i canali in cui sei è lato client / il server è solo un dispatcher"*. Sonic's counter (*"lo stato è cmq su grappa"*) is correct for **session state** — grappa must persist which networks/channels a user is attached to. The intent is narrower: the **client** owns **UI state** (open channel view, scroll position, theme); the server persists what must survive reconnect.

**Apply:** API exposes *session state* (networks, channels, scrollback), not *UI state* (read cursor, "active channel", unread counts — the client computes those locally).

---

### 2026-04-20 — decision: grappa is not an ircd

> *"grappa NON è un server irc / è un modo per rimanere connessi a irc e accedervi via webapp"*

A classic IRC client bypasses grappa and goes straight upstream. grappa is a persistent-session + REST layer on top of existing IRC — scope control: we do not ship features an ircd would ship.

**Apply:** never pitch grappa as an IRC server. "Always-on session wrapper, consumable from a phone" is correct; "modern IRC server" is wrong.

---

### 2026-04-20 — canonical elevator pitch (vjt's words)

Flagged as *"memorizza queste ultime righe perché sono una bella sintesi efficace di grappa"*. Authoritative phrasing, reusable verbatim:

- *"grappa bnc irc <-> web"* — one-line architecture: bouncer between IRC upstream and web.
- *"cicchetto consuma grappa e mostra UI themabl[e]"* — cicchetto is the client, consumes grappa's API, ships themable UI.
- *"as irssi, mirc, erc, xchat quel che si vuole"* — themability target: parity with classic IRC clients, user picks.
- *"grappa espone anche ircv3 se vuoi usare quassel o simili"* — the phase-2 IRCv3 listener is the downstream facade for mobile IRCv3 clients.
- *"se vuoi usare irssi su grappa praticamente è solo un bnc"* — classic IRC client through grappa = pure bouncer experience.
- *"se invece usi cicchetto o quassel, hai anche la history"* — scrollback is what you gain with cicchetto OR any IRCv3 client.
- *"plain and simple / irc solo irc"* — minimalism as a feature. No images, no voice, no *cagate*.

**Apply:** when describing grappa to a newcomer, lead with `grappa bnc irc <-> web` + `cicchetto consuma grappa`, then fan out: themable UI, IRCv3 facade for mobile, history via cicchetto or IRCv3, *plain and simple* as closer.

---

### 2026-04-25 — decision: Elixir/OTP + Phoenix as the server stack

The 2026-04-20 pitch named Elixir/OTP; pressure-tested before locking Phase 1.

**The four goals (vjt's framing):** multi-decade longevity; excellent client experience (flaky-mobile reconnect, multi-tab); always-on bouncer with per-user fault isolation; a Phase 6 downstream IRCv3 listener on the same scrollback.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- **Rust** (tokio + axum + sqlx + `irc` crate). Plausible; better LLM training corpus (~15-20% more idiomatic first-pass generation, named honestly). Rejected because the architecture grappa needs is BEAM's textbook example — re-implementing supervision + per-user fault isolation + multiplexed pub/sub-over-WebSocket in userspace Rust is ~2300 LOC of plumbing BEAM gives free, plus months of mobile-network polish on a WS client library that doesn't exist.
- **Go.** Would subconsciously drift back toward soju's IRCv3-first DNA, fighting the REST-first design center.
- **Zig.** Too early in 2026; 0.x churn, ecosystem too sparse for HTTP/WS/SQL.

**Why Elixir wins for THIS shape:** (1) one-persistent-supervised-process-per-user IS the runtime — `DynamicSupervisor` + `Registry` + `:transient` ≈ zero LOC of plumbing; (2) **Phoenix Channels >> SSE** — `phoenix.js` handles reconnect-with-backoff, topic re-subscription, network-change events, replay; battle-tested at Discord/Slack scale; no Rust equivalent exists — the single biggest material advantage for the user-facing experience; (3) binary pattern matching makes the Phase 6 IRC parser/state machine pleasant (telecom bytes are what Erlang was built for); (4) BEAM's 35+ year backwards-compat record for long-lived stateful systems (WhatsApp 2009, Discord 2015, Ericsson late-80s code still running); (5) per-process runtime introspection (`:observer_cli`, `:recon`, `:sys.get_state/1`) that `tokio-console` doesn't approach.

**Tradeoffs accepted, named honestly:** vjt OTP ramp 2-4 weeks (concurrent-C experience from suxserv/bahamut transfers); Claude ~15-20% less idiomatic Elixir first-pass — compensated by a **rigid all-mandatory CI gate baseline** (`mix format --check-formatted`, `credo --strict`, `dialyzer`, `sobelow --config --exit-on-medium`, `deps.audit` + `hex.audit`, `doctor`, `test --warnings-as-errors --cover` with a ratcheting floor, `docs`); `exirc` stale on hex → write our own IRC client, ~500-1000 LOC of binary-pattern-match code reusable for the Phase 6 listener parser (advantage, not punishment); larger Docker image (irrelevant — Docker is the deployment target).

**Apply:** Phase 1 stack is **Elixir 1.19 + Erlang/OTP 28 + Phoenix 1.8 + Ecto 3 + ecto_sqlite3 + own IRC client module**. Streaming facade is **Phoenix Channels**, not SSE. Every CI gate is mandatory, none advisory — they exist to compensate the first-pass fluency gap; every gate that fires saves a review round-trip.

---

### 2026-04-25 — sub-decision: hot code reload is NOT load-bearing

Raised and resolved before locking the language. Considered: **nginx-style fd-passing in Rust** (works for the inbound listen socket; fails outbound — rustls can't adopt an in-progress TLS session from serialized state, and IRC protocol state would need bespoke serde; research-project territory); **split-process Rust** (`irc-connd` + `grappa-api` — ~70% of the value, useless when patching IRC handler logic itself); **BEAM hot reload** (free, but rarely used cleanly for stateful long-lived processes).

**Decision: reconnect-on-deploy is acceptable.** Major releases restart cleanly; users see a brief quit/join flood; sysadmins manage release windows. Elixir won on the OTHER axes, not hot-reload.

**Apply:** do not over-invest in zero-downtime upgrade infrastructure during Phase 1-5. Connection-resume on the IRC side is a Phase 5+ concern, not a baseline requirement.

---

### 2026-04-25 — Phase 2 auth = opaque session IDs + sliding 7d, NOT JWT

JWT (any flavour — long-lived bearer, access+refresh, rolling) is the wrong tool for grappa's threat model. JWT was designed for stateless cross-service fan-out, federated identity (OIDC), and edge auth — NOT for a monolithic one-DB app that needs real revocation, an "active sessions" UI, or theft mitigation. Every path to those with JWT (`token_version` on users, `jti` blocklist) reintroduces a DB lookup per request and defeats the stateless win, leaving only the footguns (`alg: none`, HS256/RS256 confusion, key-rotation cascade). Five rounds of "can we just JWT?" all ended at the same place: sliding + revocation = state required.

**Shipped shape:** opaque UUID session ID as bearer (`Authorization: Bearer <session_id>`), server PK lookup per REST request (sub-ms; ~200 lookups/hour for an active user — invisible), `last_seen_at` UPDATE rate-limited to 60s, idle-7d via `now - last_seen_at`, `revoked_at` for explicit revocation. Per WS Channel: ONE lookup at `connect/3`, then zero for socket lifetime (identity pinned in `socket.assigns`). Per inbound IRC PRIVMSG: zero auth lookups (PubSub fans out to already-authenticated subscribers). Deliberately NOT signed Phoenix.Token — signing adds nothing when verification is a DB lookup anyway. The opaque `sessions` table is provider-agnostic: OAuth / WebAuthn / magic-link later each mint an identical session row; JWT couples auth flow to token format.

**Apply:** if stateless tokens are ever genuinely needed (unlikely), use **PASETO**, not JWT — same stateless property, no `alg` field, no algorithm-negotiation footgun.

---

### 2026-04-25 — Phase 2 crypto layering = server-side encryption-at-rest only; e2e is OTR-in-cicchetto

Decided after vjt's pushback on env-key-on-disk: "for real e2e security, none of this is the answer. The answer there is OTR. And cicchetto will support OTR."

| Threat | Defense |
|--------|---------|
| Passive sqlite-file theft (lost backup, stolen Pi, accidental commit) | Cloak.Ecto AES-256-GCM, env key (`GRAPPA_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) |
| Active server compromise (root'd, hostile operator, subpoena) | **OTR / OMEMO in cicchetto, ciphertext-on-wire** |
| Network surveillance (wire-tap on upstream IRC) | OTR + TLS |
| Endpoint compromise (your phone is rooted) | Nothing helps. Game over. |

Server-side encryption-at-rest covers ONLY the first row; it is not pretending to be e2e. Rejected: user-password-derived keys (decrypt NickServ creds only while logged in) — improves passive-theft but restart = mass logout, idle 8d = upstream disconnect; it sacrifices "always-on" for a property that doesn't even defend against active compromise. OTR in cicchetto (Phase 4+) covers threats 2-3: standard `?OTRv3?` PRIVMSG handshake, ciphertext in PRIVMSG bodies, upstream and grappa scrollback both see opaque text, forward secrecy + deniability free. Zero server-side work: `body` stays opaque UTF-8, no new schema, no new endpoint.

**Apply:** server-side crypto schemes for user message bodies ("encrypted messages at rest", "per-user message keys") are NEVER proposed for any future phase — that's OTR's job; route e2e/privacy questions to OTR-in-client. Phase 5+ may add HSM-keyed Vault (yubico-hsm / TPM / KMS) for operators escaping "env on disk"; Cloak.Vault makes that pluggable without code changes.

---

### 2026-04-25 — Phase 2 schema = irssi-shape (network 1:N servers, per-user credentials)

vjt: "let's reuse irssi schema here. server belongs to chatnet, chatnet has many servers." Matches how operators think: round-robin DNS endpoints, plain-6667 vs TLS-6697 are different server rows.

Three-table split: `networks` (integer pk + unique slug), `network_servers` (network_id FK + host/port/tls/priority/enabled, unique `(network_id, host, port)`), `network_credentials` (composite pk `(user_id, network_id)`; nick + realname + sasl_user + `password_encrypted` (Cloak) + auth_method enum + autojoin_channels).

**`networks.id` integer + slug:** text PK rejected (rename = cascade across messages/credentials); UUID rejected (adds nothing — stable lifecycles, non-sensitive list; integer is faster joins, simpler debug).

**Multi-server failover: schema-ready Phase 2, logic-deferred Phase 5.** `priority` + `enabled` ship now; Session uses the first enabled server; Phase 5 adds the round-robin/backoff machine as a pure logic addition, no migration.

**Per-user iso on messages (decision G):** `messages.user_id` UUID FK + index `(user_id, network_id, channel, server_time DESC)`. Each Session.Server writes its own scrollback rows from its own wire view — per-user model, not shared-de-duped (the de-dup key would be fragile under server-time latency variance, and each user's session sees joins/parts/kicks differently).

**Apply:** new IRC-network tables follow the irssi shape (logical network row + many physical endpoints); per-user resources composite-key on `(user_id, network_id[, channel])`; `messages.user_id` is the discriminator for ALL scrollback queries, no fetch path bypasses it; wire payloads NEVER carry `user_id` (decision G3 — client knows its own from `/me`, server filters from authn'd context).

---

### 2026-04-25 — Phase 2 PubSub topic shape break + per-network upstream `auth_method` state machine

**Topic break:** Phase 1 `grappa:network:{net}/channel:{chan}` → Phase 2 `grappa:user:{user}/network:{net}/channel:{chan}`. Phoenix.PubSub topics are global string namespaces, not socket-scoped; without the per-user discriminator, a multi-user instance broadcasts user A's events to user B's subscribers. vjt asked "can't the user be inferred from the session?" — only via a custom dispatch layer filtering every message per subscriber, which loses native ETS fanout + Phoenix.Presence, adds a routing layer of bug surface, and reinvents the wheel. Standard Phoenix shape: the topic string encodes the discriminator; wire surface (REST URLs, JSON keys) unchanged; user never in payloads.

**Single source of truth:** `Grappa.PubSub.Topic` builders (Phase 2 sub-task 2h). NO inline topic string interpolation anywhere; all future topics follow `grappa:user:{user}/...`. **Authz at Channel join:** `socket.assigns.user_id == topic_user_id else 403` — assigns = authenticated identity, topic portion = requested stream; the check ensures you subscribe only to your own.

**auth_method state machine (2f):** enum on `network_credentials`: `auto | sasl | server_pass | nickserv_identify | none`.

| Method | Flow | Networks |
|--------|------|----------|
| `sasl` | CAP LS 302 → REQ :sasl → AUTHENTICATE PLAIN → 903/904/905 → CAP END | ergo, Libera, Snoonet |
| `server_pass` | PASS before NICK/USER; server hands off to NickServ at register_user end | Azzurra (Bahamut), Unreal-with-services |
| `nickserv_identify` | NICK/USER → 001 → PRIVMSG NickServ :IDENTIFY pwd | Rare networks where neither PASS nor SASL works |
| `none` | NICK/USER only | IRCnet, open networks |
| `auto` | Default | Most operators |

`auto`: send PASS first if a password is present, always CAP LS 302 + NICK/USER, then react — sasl advertised → SASL flow; `421 Unknown command CAP` → server already handled PASS via NickServ if configured; 001 → autojoin. NickServ NOTICEs logged but not parsed in Phase 2 (Phase 5 hardens: reply parsing + post-001 `+r`-umode check falling back to `PRIVMSG NickServ :IDENTIFY` — catches PASS-not-bound edge cases and silent failures).

**Bahamut PASS-handoff verified via source dive:** `bahamut-azzurra/src/s_user.c:1273-1278` — at the end of `register_user()`, a stashed PASS triggers a server-side `SIDENTIFY` PRIVMSG to NickServ. Poor-man's SASL: auth at register-time via the legacy PASS field, no race, no post-001 IDENTIFY dance. Bahamut's `CAPAB` strings are server-to-server negotiation (TS3, NOQUIT, SSJOIN, BURST), NOT IRCv3 client `CAP LS`.

**Apply:** operator declares `auth_method` at `mix grappa.bind_network`; `auto` is safe for ~99% of networks; explicit `sasl` forces no-PASS-fallback for operators worried about leaking the password to networks that don't bind PASS to services; `nickserv_identify` is the explicit override for the rare network where neither works.

---

### 2026-04-25 — sub-decision: single sqlite file, not per-user `.db`

Alternative considered: one `.db` per user, lazily started Repos via `put_dynamic_repo`. What it buys: zero cross-user writer contention, per-user delete/export = file ops, sqlcipher option, crash isolation, trivial disk quota.

What it costs: (1) plumbing tax forever — every context fn gains a `user_id` arg + `with_user_repo` wrapper (~200 LOC + 200 risk points); (2) a silent-bug class — one forgotten `put_dynamic_repo` writes alice's messages into bob's DB, and the mitigation ("never start a default Repo") breaks `mix ecto.migrate`, LiveDashboard, and bare iex; (3) custom migration runner iterating all user DBs + schema-drift decisions at boot; (4) cross-user aggregates need fan-out helpers; (5) N× connection-pool memory; (6) the performance argument is fake at this scale — ~83 msg/sec write rate vs sqlite WAL's 10k+/sec on a Pi.

**Coherence beats theoretical isolation.** The codebase IS the instruction set; half-`user_id`-first-args = drift. Privacy-via-file-separation is theater for a single-operator bouncer where the operator can read the file regardless. **Flip-condition, named:** if grappa ever becomes a multi-tenant adversarial-isolation product, per-user `.db` is correct *upfront* — retrofitting privacy after a shared schema is harder than the ergonomics tax. Current spec: single Pi, single operator, trusted few.

**Also rejected: PostgreSQL/MySQL.** A server DB adds a separate process, ~250MB idle RAM on the Pi, dump-based backups, config tuning, a network hop — zero benefit two orders of magnitude under the WAL ceiling. If scale ever flips, Postgres is the upgrade target, not MySQL (better SQL semantics, JSONB, no utf8mb4 trauma, better Ecto integration).

**Apply:** one `Grappa.Repo`, single db file, standard `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox` per-test isolation, normal `mix ecto.migrate`. Revisit only on the multi-tenant flip-condition.

### 2026-04-26 — Phase 2 close: User.name format is free-text, not enum

`Grappa.Accounts.User.name` is `:string` with `validate_format ~r/^[a-z0-9_-]{1,32}$/i` — a free-text identifier, NOT an `Ecto.Enum`. The atoms-or-typed-literals rule applies to closed sets the *code* knows about (message kinds, auth methods); the User namespace is operator-extensible at runtime (`mix grappa.create_user`). The format excludes whitespace, control bytes, IRC framing chars (`!`, `@`, `:`, `,`), and locale-dependent normalization (`String.downcase/1` is locale-aware on UTF-8). The 32-char ceiling is below IRC's typical NICKLEN (Azzurra ships NICKLEN=30) so a User.name can be used AS the upstream nick — though the per-credential `nick` field is the canonical IRC identity. What it buys: clean URLs, clean Logger metadata (`user=vjt`), clean topic shapes (`grappa:user:vjt`). The UUID PK stays for FK purposes.

### 2026-04-26 — Phase 2 close: Network.slug is URL- and topic-safe

`Network.slug` is `:string` with `validate_format ~r/^[a-z0-9-]{1,32}$/` — like User.name but lowercase-only, no underscore, slug-safe by construction (RFC 3986 reserved chars + topic delimiters all excluded). The slug rides three surfaces that all require passthrough safety: REST paths (`/networks/azzurra/...`), PubSub topics, operator CLI argv. Free-text would force escaping at every layer. Trade-off accepted: display name lost; a future `Network.display_name` column can ride alongside — the slug stays the load-bearing identifier.

### 2026-04-26 — Phase 2 close: G2 wipe-and-rebuild over migration

Phase 1's `messages.user_id` was free-text (hardcoded `"vjt"`); Phase 2 made it a UUID FK to `users.id`. Chose **wipe + recreate the dev/prod DB** over a backfill migration: the data was throwaway walking-skeleton chatter; backfill was semantically impossible (rows pre-date the operator's account — the FK would be fabricated); 60+ lines of migration scaffolding for data about to be deleted. **Flip-condition:** had Phase 2 landed after any production deploy with real scrollback, the migration would have been mandatory regardless of cost.

**Apply:** from post-Phase-2 close onward, schema changes that touch FK columns get migrations, not wipes.

### 2026-04-26 — Phase 2 close: no `delete_network/1`; cascade-on-empty-unbind only

Superseded twice: the admin-panel B1 cluster added an explicit, doubly-gated `Networks.delete_network/1`; GH #105 (see the 2026-06-28 entry) removed cascade-on-empty-unbind and the `:scrollback_present` rollback — unbind now ONLY detaches the credential, never deletes the network.

### 2026-04-26 — Phase 2 close: IRCv3 CAP ACK gate + Bahamut PASS-handoff verification

`Grappa.IRC.Client`'s registration handshake gates SASL behind a CAP LS / CAP REQ / CAP ACK round-trip. Non-ACK → fall through to `:server_pass` (PASS handoff) when `auth_method: :auto`, OR raise `:sasl_unavailable` when `:sasl` was explicit.

**Why the gate:** per IRCv3.2, sending `AUTHENTICATE PLAIN` after a non-ACK is undefined behavior — servers variously ignore it, 421, or 904. The ACK gate makes the unsupported branch deterministic.

**The Bahamut detail:** Azzurra runs Bahamut 1.4(34). Bahamut accepts `PASS <pw>` BEFORE NICK + USER, stashes it, and post-001 routes it to NickServ via the services protocol (`s_user.c` reference in the 2026-04-25 auth_method entry). Modern Anope/Atheme do the same. `:server_pass` emits PASS first, then NICK + USER, then waits for 001 — exactly the flow Bahamut expects.

**`:sasl_unavailable` rationale:** an operator who explicitly chose `:sasl` picked pre-001 auth (no IRC traffic before auth); silently falling back to PASS-as-NickServ (post-001 — a brief window on the network as the unidentified nick) would change the auth boundary. Fail loud; the operator updates the credential or accepts the weaker boundary explicitly.

### 2026-04-26 — Phase 2 close: NoServerError as exception, not `{:error, :no_server}`

`Grappa.Networks.NoServerError` (post-A2/A10 module moves) is RAISED, not returned, when `Networks.Servers.list_servers/1` returns `[]` at session-init. Under `restart: :transient`, an `{:error, _}` from `init/1` and a raise both make the supervisor retry against unchanging state — the difference is the **operator log**: the tuple yields a one-liner "child failed: :no_server"; the exception yields a stack trace pointing at `Server.init/1` plus the network slug. For an operator-action failure (forgot `mix grappa.add_server`), the stack trace is the better signal. Phase 5 mitigation queued: refuse `bind_credential/3` until at least one Server row exists — invariant at the API surface, not the runtime.

### 2026-04-26 — Phase 3 cicchetto stack: SolidJS + TypeScript + Vite + Bun + Biome

The choice is load-bearing — re-platforming after Phase 4 cements themes + keybindings would cost weeks. **Chosen:** SolidJS 1.9 + TypeScript 6 + Vite 8 + Bun 1.3 + Biome 2.4 + `phoenix.js` 1.8.

**Why:** Solid's fine-grained reactivity matches the workload — every IRC event is a separate Channel push (busy channels: hundreds of events/sec); signals re-render only the changed DOM node, no VDOM diff over thousands of scrollback rows. TypeScript extends the server's typed JSON contracts across the boundary — one contract, two languages, compile-time-checked. Vite is Solid's first-party bundler. Bun replaces npm + node entirely (`oven/bun:1` image matches the `scripts/bun.sh` oneshot wrapper discipline mirroring `scripts/mix.sh`). Biome replaces ESLint + Prettier — one Rust-fast tool, one config, mirroring the `mix format` + credo single-source principle.

**Rejected:** **React** — VDOM cost wrong for the workload; the device that matters is an iPhone on cellular; ecosystem/corpus advantage doesn't outweigh it. **Svelte** — thinner WS ecosystem; phoenix.js maps directly onto Solid signals, Svelte stores need a wrapper layer. **Plain lit-html** — too minimalist; the irssi-shape UI needs enough state machinery that we'd reinvent 80% of Solid. **htmx + SSR** — loses the PWA offline story, the install path, and the WS-push model. **Web Components** — shadow-DOM CSS isolation actively fights the one-global-theme goal.

**Tradeoffs named honestly:** Claude ~10-20% less idiomatic Solid vs React first-pass (same mitigation playbook as Elixir: rigid CI gates + accumulated pattern notes); Bun younger than Node — stick to Bun-first or framework-agnostic packages, Phase 5 item if a dep ever forces Node-only; Biome's thinner plugin ecosystem covers ~95% and the missing 5% (React-specific rules) doesn't apply.

**Apply:** cicchetto lives at `cicchetto/` in THIS monorepo (CP09 correction). NEVER raw `bun`/`npm`/`node` on the host — `scripts/bun.sh` only. CI gates: Biome lint + format, tsc strict, vitest — all mandatory. Future "modernize" temptations (Next.js, Tailwind, pnpm) MUST re-litigate this entry; the rejections don't expire. Prod: `cicchetto-build` oneshot builds `dist/` into the `cicchetto_dist` volume; nginx serves the SPA with `try_files` + reverse-proxies `/auth /me /networks /healthz /socket` to `grappa:4000`; the bouncer container does NOT bundle the frontend.

### 2026-04-26 — Phase 2 close: `password_encrypted` redact:true is post-load symmetry

Both the Cloak column `password_encrypted` AND the virtual `:password` field carry `redact: true`; dropping either leaks plaintext in a different lifecycle phase. Cloak's `:load` callback decrypts on fetch — AFTER load, `password_encrypted` holds the CLEARTEXT in memory (and `:password` is nil, being input-only); BEFORE load (changeset shape), `:password` holds the plaintext. The original 2f code missed the encrypted-column half; review I3 caught that `IO.inspect(credential)` after a fetch printed the cleartext.

**Apply:** any Cloak-encrypted column whose load-decrypted value is sensitive carries `redact: true` on the encrypted column itself, not just the virtual input field. Redaction is symmetric with the field's lifecycle, not with its name.

### 2026-04-26 — Phase 3 wrap: WS `check_origin` is the defense-in-depth on bearer-in-querystring

The Channels WS connect carries the bearer as `?token=…`; `check_origin` is the second line — Phoenix validates the handshake's `Origin` header against an allowlist BEFORE bearer auth runs. Phase 3 shipped without overriding it, so prod inherited Phoenix's default ("match the endpoint URL host") = localhost — **every real WS connect from `http://grappa.bad.ass` was rejected** until `config/runtime.exs`'s prod block read `PHX_HOST` into both `url:` and `check_origin:`.

**Two layers, both load-bearing:** (1) bearer-in-querystring authn in `UserSocket.connect/3` rejects unknown/expired/revoked tokens; (2) `check_origin` rejects foreign-origin handshakes before the bearer is even read — defense-in-depth against XSS-chain-exfil shapes.

**Apply:**

- Any deployment under a new hostname MUST set `PHX_HOST` in `.env`.
- The `//host` scheme-relative form covers both http + https — keep the form across TLS migration.
- A future feature needing a different host (e.g. a login-free public-status endpoint) lands as a separate Phoenix.Endpoint, not as a relaxation here.
- `filter_parameters` includes `token` AND nginx suppresses `access_log` for `/socket`. Both mandatory; either alone leaves the bearer in a different log file.

## Open design questions

Tracked here until resolved in the README or an issue.

- ~~**Client framework:** Svelte vs SolidJS vs plain lit-html. Decision deferred to Phase 3 (client walking skeleton). Criteria: PWA shell ergonomics, service-worker story, bundle size budget (≤200 KB gzip target before optional Vosk/piper drop-ins). Note: any choice integrates with `phoenix.js` (3KB, framework-agnostic) for the Channels client.~~ **Resolved 2026-04-26:** SolidJS 1.9 + TypeScript 6 + Vite 8 + Bun 1.3 + Biome 2.4 + `phoenix.js` 1.8. See dedicated DESIGN_NOTES entry above.
- **KV vs sqlite for scrollback:** sqlite via `ecto_sqlite3` is the chosen default. The pagination-heavy access pattern + per-user row counts + the need for indexed lookup by (channel, server-time) all favour SQL. Revisit only if the sqlite file turns out to be the bottleneck.
- ~~**Session token format:** `Phoenix.Token` short-lived access + long-lived refresh, or single long-lived + revocation list. Phase 2 concern.~~ **Resolved 2026-04-25:** opaque UUID session ID + sliding 7d idle expiry + revocation table. See dedicated DESIGN_NOTES entry above.
- **How to expose multi-network per user in the UI** without descending into tree-view hell. Phase 3 concern.
- **Coverage floor:** start CI at 80%; ratchet up each major release. No exclusion lists — if a file is hard to test, the design needs fixing, not the gate.
